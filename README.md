WE ARE MAKING OUR OWN GOOGLE HOME PAGE - CODE CHALLENGE LAP 1 WEDNESDAY



Requirements
Your version of Google should have a homepage, with a logo, search bar and two buttons.
Upon pressing one button an API call should be executed and users should be shown a page with ten results.
Upon pressing the other, users should be taken to the page of one of the results.
NB: You are creating your own API. It is up to you if you want to make use of the Google Search API in addition but it is not a requirement. Your API can have a limited selection of 'result' options that might be returned for a few search terms
