## Project Feedback 

### What we really liked:
*  Great user interface! Your page really looks like the Google homepage. 
*  Good use of input fields & buttons. The styling is great. 
*  We also like the subtle personalizaton of the page too. 
*  Good use of various technologiess (e.g jQuery).
*  Good utilisation of variables & functions.
*  We liked that you made use of comments.
*  We also liked how you added multiple cool functions on your API.

### Areas for improvement:
* Maybe make the comments more detailed for better readability of your code.
* Try and format the HTML & CSS with spacing so its easier to read.
* Add a .gitignore so that unnecessary 'node_modules' modules aren't uploaded.
* 'httpStatusCodes' objects seems unnecessary as it hasn't been used elsewhere in code & in other files so unsure why it was exported (re: 'module.exports:').
* There are two functions called 'randomFont()' which was slightly confusing.
* RE:'form.addEventListener('click', getFeelingLucky)', could've added 'document.getElementById("form")' to link the event listener as the variable 'form' was not declared.
